      <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Kurt David V. Tancio, and I’m 20 years old, turning 21 this August 20.<sup>1</sup> 
        I was born in Manila on that date in 2004, but my hometown is San Mateo, Rizal, where I grew up for 20 years.<sup>2</sup> 
        We moved to different houses within San Mateo, but it always felt like home.<sup>3</sup> 
        My childhood memories in San Mateo are some of my best, especially since I witnessed the transformation of the area from a province to a city.<sup>4</sup> 
        Living in the province had its charm, but things changed as it grew into a bustling urban environment.<sup>5</sup> 
        As a child, I was always immersed in gaming, especially FPS and MOBA games like Counter-Strike, Dota, and Battle Realms.<sup>6</sup> 
        I can still vividly remember the excitement of having my first computer set up for gaming.<sup>7</sup> 
        My mother would always scold me when I played for too long, but I couldn’t help myself.<sup>8</sup> 
        Despite the scoldings, my mother and I have a very close relationship.<sup>9</sup> 
        I always tell her about my day, whether it was good or bad, and I’m never shy around her.<sup>10</sup> 
        On the other hand, my relationship with my father is more distant.<sup>11</sup> 
        We don’t talk much, except when I need to ask for my allowance.<sup>12</sup> 
        It’s not that I don’t love him, but we’re simply not as close as I am with my mother.<sup>13</sup> 
        I attended Eastern Star Academy for preschool and grade school, where I learned valuable lessons about friendship and decision-making.<sup>14</sup> 
        Growing up, I didn’t have many friends since I was an introvert, mostly focused on my games.<sup>15</sup> 
        But that didn’t bother me because the games helped me develop important skills like hand-eye coordination, logic, and problem-solving.<sup>16</sup> 
        Even now, when I face challenges, I often apply the logic and decision-making skills I honed while gaming.<sup>17</sup> 
        Looking back, I see how my gaming experiences shaped who I am today, especially in how I approach problem-solving.<sup>18</sup>

    <!-- Teenage Years Section -->
    <section id="teenage-years" class="section">
      <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
      <p>
        My teenage years were some of the best experiences of my life.<sup>1</sup> 
                From Grade 7 to 10, I wasn’t an honor student—I was more of an average student.<sup>2</sup> 
                In Grade 7, I was just enjoying my life as a first-time high school student, so my grades were around 80-85.<sup>3</sup> 
                In Grade 7, I developed an interest in playing basketball, volleyball, and chess.<sup>4</sup> 
                Thankfully, I made it to our high school basketball team, and from there, I enjoyed playing basketball more than studying.<sup>5</sup> 
                From Grade 7 to 9, I played basketball, but in the middle of Grade 8, I got cut from my basketball team because my grades were failing.<sup>6</sup> 
                I needed to improve my grades to return to the team.<sup>7</sup> 
                Getting cut from the team humbled me because, even though I was performing very well and winning some awards, they still cut me.<sup>8</sup> 
                It was a valuable lesson for me.<sup>9</sup> 
                I learned how to manage my time and prioritize what’s important.<sup>10</sup> 
                During my varsity years, the school gave us an allowance to spend on important things like maintenance for our bodies, face, etc.<sup>11</sup> 
                But as a kid, I ended up spending it on less important things like video game skins and going out with friends.<sup>12</sup> 
                I eventually learned how to control it.<sup>13</sup> 
                When I got back on the team, I felt like a new person because I had learned my lesson.<sup>14</sup> 
                The principal and my mother were very close, and they both scolded me for about two quarters.<sup>15</sup> 
                But I'm very thankful for them because it changed my perspective on life.<sup>16</sup> 
                Then Grade 10 came, and everything was going fine.<sup>17</sup> 
                I was graduating from high school, and then all of a sudden, my mother got sick, and COVID happened.<sup>18</sup> 
                This chapter in my life was the most challenging part.<sup>19</sup> 
                My mother had cancer, and because of COVID, my siblings and I couldn’t visit the hospital.<sup>20</sup> 
                We couldn’t even show her how much we loved her or support her in person.<sup>21</sup> 
                We always did video calls, but it wasn’t enough.<sup>22</sup> 
                Of course, as her children, we wanted to see her in person, not just on a screen.<sup>23</sup> 
                We wanted to take care of her.<sup>24</sup> 
                Fast forward through a couple of difficult months—about two to three months.<sup>25</sup> 
                In the first month, my mother came home.<sup>26</sup> 
                The doctor said she could stay home, and since hospital expenses were extremely high, we decided to bring her home before the bills piled up.<sup>27</sup> 
                When she came home, we all cried every day, especially me.<sup>28</sup> 
                I'm a mama’s boy, and I love her so much.<sup>29</sup> 
                Seeing her lying in bed with a machine attached to her body so she could eat, breathe, drink, and pee broke my heart.<sup>30</sup> 
                Whenever I imagine or dream of it, sometimes I cry because it was the most painful phase of my life.<sup>31</sup> 
                In the second month, she started experiencing hair loss, which is normal for cancer patients.<sup>32</sup> 
                Then came the blood vomiting and other complications.<sup>33</sup> 
                In the third month, my mother passed away.<sup>34</sup> 
                My heart was shattered into pieces.<sup>35</sup> 
                I didn’t know how to act, what to feel, or what to say.<sup>36</sup> 
                She was my best friend and my mother.<sup>37</sup> 
                Fast forward, she was buried, and I started losing interest in basketball and video games.<sup>38</sup> 
                But then I started recovering because I realized that I wasn’t the only one grieving.<sup>39</sup> 
                My family was also grieving, and that motivated me to study and return to my hobbies.<sup>40</sup> 
                At this time, I was a Grade 11 student.<sup>41</sup> 
                I graduated online from my previous school and then studied at Arellano University for two years.<sup>42</sup> 
                I chose the ICT strand.<sup>43</sup> 
                I only chose it because my father is also in IT, and I wanted to give it a try.<sup>44</sup> 
                Then it piqued my interest because it’s very tech-savvy, and the world is advancing, so I thought, why not try it?<sup>45</sup> 
                Two years passed, and I graduated from senior high school at Arellano University.<sup>46</sup> 
                I also met a very pretty and cute woman from Philippine Women’s University.<sup>47</sup> 
                We met in a UV Express, a public transport service.<sup>48</sup> 
                Her friend approached me when I was about to get off and asked for my name and socials.<sup>49</sup> 
                At first, I was hesitant to message her back because she had messaged me first.<sup>50</sup> 
                Then I realized she looked familiar because she was also from San Mateo, and we were both athletes.<sup>51</sup> 
                I checked her profile, then we talked, dated, and worked out together.<sup>52</sup> 
                We had many similar interests.<sup>53</sup> 
                The little things like that made me happy.<sup>54</sup> 
                Now, here we are both in our second year of college, pursuing the courses we chose.<sup>55</sup> 
                I wish and pray that she becomes very successful.<sup>56</sup> 
                I want to give her everything she wants.<sup>57</sup> 
                A little backstory—our childhoods were quite different.<sup>58</sup> 
                I was spoiled, while she didn't always get what she wanted.<sup>59</sup> 
                So whenever we go out, I always make sure to treat her and give her what she wants.<sup>60</sup> 
                I really hope she is the one I will marry in the future.<sup>61</sup> 
                I guess this is what love does to people.<sup>62</sup>

    <!-- College Years Section -->

      <h2>College Years</h2>
      <p>
        College life so far—my experience at the University of the East has been a little tough.<sup>1</sup> 
        Back in Arellano University, when I chose the ICT strand, they didn’t have the lab or equipment to teach us properly.<sup>2</sup> 
        I don’t know if the problem was the teacher or the equipment, but for the whole two years, I didn’t learn much.<sup>3</sup> 
        I only learned the basics.<sup>4</sup> 
        That’s why I’m having a tough time in UE right now.<sup>5</sup> 
        But I have friends in UE who are always willing to help whenever I don’t understand the instructions or what to do.<sup>6</sup> 
        They are always there, and I’m very thankful for them.<sup>7</sup> 
        I wish and pray that my friends and I graduate together, even though we are struggling.<sup>8</sup> 
        I also hope to learn the things I need to be a successful IT professional in the near future.<sup>9</sup> 
        I’m pursuing this for myself and my family, especially for my mother.<sup>10</sup> 
        I want to make her proud.<sup>11</sup> 
        I want to learn everything about IT, whatever it takes.<sup>12</sup>
